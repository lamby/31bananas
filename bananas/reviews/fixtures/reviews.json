I'd never actually seen them before but given they had such a short expiry time I was compelled to include them earlier in the month.  \r\n\r\nLike millionaire's, each bite consists of essentially three layers: the base is a slightly crispy banoffee-flavoured honeycomb, a fudge layer sits in the middle and banana chips are then slightly embedded into the top like crazy paving.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is where the problems start; each layer is tasted separately rather than as a blend and each part isn't nearly good enough to carry the entire bite - the banana chips are quite hard and don't mix well with the softer layers below, the fudge is slightly uninspiring and the banoffee honeycomb doesn't have enough of a banana flavour \"hit\" to compensate.\r\n\r\nWhilst the price point is fairly reasonable, they are difficult to recommend as a portable banana snack: not only are they very fragile and liable to melt (bike food this is not) it seems a little cruel to pack 600 calories in such an uninspiringly small pack. Given the surprisingly short shelf life (~1 week) one cannot even stockpile them the winter (or banana) shortage.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for them in your local Tesco, they live near the Stroopwafels.

It's a bit of a paradox, existing somewhere in the wasteland between cake and bread but somehow manages to be simultaneously soft and heavy.\r\n\r\nSoreen itself seems to survive mostly on its own reputation (you will all of course recall the \"75 years of Soreen\" nationwide celebrations in 2013...?) and I'm fairly confident it would not be developed from scratch today. It comes across as an anachronism like spam, Fisherman's Friend mints, or those small red tins of pilchards.\r\n\r\n\u00abGood for cycling!\u00bb I am told, but that's probably more to do with a demographic overlap than anything else. Whilst calorie dense and has a reasonable macro-nutrient ratios, there is no avoiding the major issue with Soreen: if you compress or squish it in *any* way, it can never return to its original shape. In that way it reminds me of a used IKEA memory foam mattress with the corresponding aesthetics and resale value. Perhaps worse are the teeth marks left after one takes a bite - not pictured as it's just a little weird. Decidedly non-Newtonian.\r\n\r\nIt typically comes in an inconveniently-sized loaf for snacking so marketing pressure has likely dictated they go after the growing and margin-rich \"lunchbox\" market, resulting in these individually wrapped portions. The packaging for this banana variant is quite attractive, with even a few token attempts at marketing to people under 50, but a *Spot The Difference* puzzle and \"quirky\" copy redolent of an Innocent Smoothie just feels out of place here.\r\n\r\nUpon opening a loaf it looked a little sad; slightly lobsided and with a manufactured surface looking like an airline brioche. However, there's a very nice aroma of banana which increased when I tore it in half. The taste is less \"malt\" than regular Soreen and the texture isn't as sticky, although the latter is probably due to its diminutive size. Banana-wise, you are never blown away, but you get just enough of a hit to make you want a little more.\r\n\r\nYou get five loaves per packet, resulting in a unit cost of 20p which it seems excellent value. Each loaf is surprisingly filling too and I made an acceptable breakfast out of a pair of them. Somewhat reassuringly, Soreen doesn't last forever - my loaves had an expiration date about a fortnight into the future. English Twinkies they are not.\r\n\r\nWould recommend them if you can transport them safely.",

Whilst they are certainly stocked at Tesco, they appear out of place at the more plebian superstores where they are relegated to that weird section with \u00a34.25 gluten-free pizza bases. A rather pretentious diacritic (specifically, a *macron*) above the 'a' certainly helps promote this sense of affectation.\r\n\r\nThat 'a' might even be an ironic postmodern reference to the `heavy-metal umlaut <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_umlaut>`_ especially given how anti-industrial these bars are; as they boast, these are \"just\" dates with a few other ingredients blended together and then cold-pressed. They helpfully print the balance of ingredients on the back too, so there is even a temptation to make one's own...\r\n\r\nComparing the two, they have pretty much the same base; a lovely datey core with a just enough hint of \"dried\" banana. However, the banana crunch is very slightly crispy and just that slight bit of resistance and depth of texture actually makes it the far superior bar. The \"banana bread\" is not really bread at all and is much softer and plainer. Still delicious, just outdone.\r\n\r\nThe only drawback appears to be the price - even in multipacks (`or direct <http://www.naturalbalancefoods.co.uk/nakd-crunch-bars/nakd-banana-crunch-bar/>`_) they just feel about 20p more than they \"should\". Whilst going gluten-free would not be devoid of nice things to eat whatsover, it might be a little expensive.\r\n\r\nJust the thing for a mid-afternoon snack. Absolutely love them.",

The screw lid is actually a `folly <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folly>`_, masking the actual foil lid underneath. The smell is *okay*, not industrial like Frijj, but hardly a bouquet of banana either. The taste is curious but I can't quite put my finger on it - the overwhelming flavour might be a combination of UHT and sugar; banana is considered a third or fourth class citizen to Yazoo.\r\n\r\nI'd stick with Frijj to be honest.",

Now in fairness, it clearly states it's suitable for anyone over 6 months...\r\n\r\nBefore sampling my pouch, I broke a little rule I had set for myself and looked at other reviews - were other adults eating this stuff? Some of them were slightly obtuse on the matter. Take the following review from `\"It's a MOM thing\" <http://www.momthingreviews.com/2013/11/ellas-kitchen-review-nicole.html>`_ - is this second-hand from her daughter? It seems almost deliberately vague:\r\n\r\n   It had an amazing banana flavor that stuck out above all else [...]\r\n\r\nWhilst I bought mine at Sainsbury's, it's clearly marketed at the \"Waitrose mum\"; cuddly font, 100% organic, eco packaging, etc. (Also available: a range of spelt and fennel snacks for toddlers. Not kidding.) You get the idea. It claims to be for vegetarians too, which raises interesting ontological questions over whether a babe of a mere six months has sufficient *mens rea* to be classed a vegetarian.\r\n\r\nYes, I'm prevaricating - what did it taste like..? Well, banana, yoghurt and rice. Kinda. Once I made sure nobody was watching, I squirted a bit out of the pouch to find it had the consistency of American hot-dog mustard. No \"bits\" or definition whatsoever.\r\n\r\nAnd it didn't actually smell that great either, with a rather sharp rice/yoghurt overtone. It was definitely banana flavoured but it was really rather muted and then masked by the aforementioned rice.\r\n\r\nFinally tasting it, it was wholly unremarkable and really rather bland, unsurprising given the unrefined palate of the intended audience. I was slightly let down to be honest, implying I was somehow expecting some kind of hidden world of flavour only revealed to children.\r\n\r\nIs it good value? Well, it didn't fill me up so I guess not. I have also no idea how much this costs compared to the alternatives or even how much it costs to raise a child. I suppose announcing that I reviewed baby food will act as a social prophylactic, certainly keeping me from learning these facts for many years.",

I suppose it's better than \"froghurt\", but they are both incredibly ugly words.\r\n\r\nThe specialist shops around London seem to be eerily similar, each having essentially the same bright-pastel-colour-on-white aesthetic and seemingly deviate only on how they sexualise the process of refrigerating fermented milk and adding toppings from a tray (\"Snog\", \"Lick\", \"Smooch\", etc.)\r\n\r\nLick is no different here, opting for orange and pink paired with an `Pasche-tiche <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Pasche>`_ tongue. Whilst available in larger tubs, smaller cinema-sized tubs seem to be more widespread. This might make sense given that the primary purpose of these bigger tubs is clearly bin\u2014sorry\u2014\"comfort\" eating, so it seems a little nonsensical to offer that for a perceived healthy product anyway.\r\n\r\nI was actually outsmarted by my diminutive pot. I had oh-so-cleverly chilled a spoon alongside my dessert but found that the lid actually conceals a cute little scoop. Perhaps they should trumpet that so it can be bought to eat on the street rather than something that needs taking home?\r\n\r\nDigging in, the taste is much more \"honey\" than banana at first. The banana surfaces as a nice afterthought though; not terribly strong and reminding one of a real frozen banana than anything artificial. The texture is not as creamy as real ice cream, but that's probably a trade-off for the calories (at only 106 calories per pot, a rough calculation puts that as \u2153 the calories of the equivalent H\u00e4agen-Dazs). It also melted fairly quickly even though I wasn't really handling it, in case that sort of thing rubs you the wrong way.\r\n\r\n\u00a31.70 seems fairly good value compared to a Magnum, but my observation is that there is always one tub of ~\u00a35 ice cream at half price making it a difficult buy if there's more than one of you.

It's not captured very well in the photographs but it's vaguely transparent and has a congruent \"army\" aesthetic throughout. I suppose it's the grown-up equivalent of your parents pretending the spoon they were trying to feed you with is an aeroplane - somewhat patronising but remarkably effective.\r\n\r\nSaying that, the actual item looked a little *too* manufactured - flapjacks are surely meant to be a little unruly, not so... uniform. Anyway, there was a pretty good banana smell straight away and the taste is really quite good, nowhere near as sweet as a regular flapjack and the texture is reassuringly chunky. Despite being \"banoffee\", I'm not sure I would mention \"toffee\" if asked the flavour blindly. Satiety-wise, it's big and filling; you feel like you're eating something substantial and the taste doesn't get boring or too intense despite that.\r\n\r\nBought individually at \u00a31.59 it's a rather expensive one-off snack, but a box at \u00a31 each (eg. `Amazon <http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00I6CDONY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00I6CDONY&linkCode=as2&tag=chrislambcouk-21>`_) could be good value. Even then, it's sold as a protein bar yet \"only\" contains 16g protein so couldn't really replace one's incredibly masculine post-workout shake.\r\n\r\nStill, enjoyable.",

However, in my unwavering quest for banana-flavoured snacks for I located a packet in Ireland and immediately undertook the 600 mile round-trip in order to sample them. Hence the late-in-the-day posting of this review. Or something.\r\n\r\nThe slices come in a \"snap pack\" of 6 individually wrapped cakes, presumably in order to create the maximum post-gluttony evidence, guilt and self-loathing. Each one is essentially a toffee-flavoured sponge with a banana-flavoured filling, topped with some yellow icing. \r\n\r\nTaking the sponge first, these sort of packaged cakes always tread a fine line \u2014 either they are made quite moist and therefore feel a little hollow and insubstantial or they are too dry and require some sort of liquid to make them properly palatable. I suppose this problem was solved years ago, where the adjustment of moistness could be dynamically adjusted with the application of custard or double cream.\r\n\r\nThese particurlar slices have erred on the \"moist\" side, which also causes it to be a just slightly slimey. The fondant icing seems a bit of a redundant too, simply adding an unnecessary \"pure sugar\" dimension to the palate, but I suppose it also ensures that the cake doesn't fall apart in an undignified manner.\r\n\r\nAnd the banana? Well, there's certainly a nice banana smell when opening the packet but the inner filling is far more toffee than banana. To be sure, it *is* there, but as a halo effect rather than a real \"hit\".\r\n\r\nIt is said that Mr Kipling makes exceedingly good cakes, but we should always remember that this was put about by the man himself and we can hardly consider him to be unbiased on this particular topic.\r\n",

Like the N\u0101kd bars, it actually tasted like real banana rather than some 1980s industrial byproduct (hello, PowerBar).\r\n\r\nI took my bar out on a short bike ride comprising repeats of a steep local hill. It wasn't the ideal choice of food for anaerobic efforts\u2014the higher GI of a gel might have suited the intensity a bit better\u2014but it didn't seem to linger too long in the stomach and there was no hint of, well, \"return\". The bars also seem quite practical and are likely to maintain their shape and consistency in the warm and cold, as well as providing that important semblance of \"real food\" amongst all the maltodextrin-laden sports drinks and gels.\r\n\r\nDespite that, they remain difficult to wholeheartedly recommend - as a sports bar, you can probably find something a little better (& cheaper) and as a banana snack they just don't stick out from the crowd.",

Well, not really that much at all. In fact, in a blind taste test I would even be tempted to say it was vanilla flavoured, but there is banana there. Like the other packet oats, it's obviously fairly sugarey which, whilst not unpleasant, seems at odds with the \"gym\" angle.\r\n\r\nPerhaps like the actual bench press, it's an exercise mostly for show, for style and artifice over substance.

No. Too weak to really spice up a dish or to be used as a serious topping (cf. Encona) yet somehow too strong and opinionated to be used as \"background cosmic radiation\" (eg. Sriracha).\r\n\r\n`Similar to Fanta <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanta#History>`_, banana sauce (or \"catsup\") was a product of WWII where locals substituted as best they could the American products.

We couldn't seem to get enough of these curiously-packaged desserts, with entire supermarket aisles dedicated to these inconveniently storable snacks. Available in multipacks of pallet-sized proportions, shops challenged the frugal shopper's mental arithmetic with a dizzying array of X-for-\u00a3Y offers that would make even the most numerically savvy bookmaker pause during his weekly shop.\r\n\r\nAnd when a \"corner\" snack was not being quaffed, conversation on the correct mixing technique was on someone's lips instead. Does one fold over the corner in one go, mix \"as you go\", or even eat the two parts entirely separately...? Were we really so starved of culinary variety that a simple fare of unmixed ingredients was enough to satiate both our stomachs and our sense of accomplishment?\r\n\r\nThey may have fallen out of favour in recent years but they still exist in what I think are the same flavours. I picked up the Banana Chocolate Flakes variety (tagline: \"banana yogurt with milk chocolate coated cornflakes\") for my first banana review of the month.\r\n\r\nAfter a small individual nibble of each I opted for an \"all in\" approach, boldly turning over the corner in one swift movement like a Tudor executioner. A quick volume calcuation would suggest it would not work the other way around, or at least would not generate a humourous enough picture to justify another 75p. I did lick the foil lid.\r\n\r\nBy itself the yoghurt is only slightly bananarey, quite sweet and let down by waterey consistency. One might also criticise the cornflakes for being too small, but this actually turns out to be an advantage later due to the increased chocolate surface area. After mixing the two, however, the whole offering improves but ends up tasting more like chocolate than banana. It isn't bad, but if one is really after a chocolate yoghurt, I'm sure there are better candidates.\r\n\r\nValue-wise, I don't believe they represent the best yoghurt experience, let along the best banana experience - it didn't really fill me up at all or provide a nice underline to my meal. Admittedly I bought mine as a single at a premium over an enormous multipack, but even at 50p each I'm not sure I could recommend them as a banana-specific treat.\r\n\r\nUltimately, slightly disappointed but probably worth eating first out of your pallet of 4,000.",

And just to be sure I'd review two products at once.\r\n\r\nFor those not in the know Frijj (pronounced \"fridge\") is the most popular milkshake in the UK, outsold at garages presumably only by petrol itself. In the past decade they've really jumped on the limited edition bandwagon (\"Jaffa Cake\", anyone?) but their core flavours remain strawberry, chocolate and, of course, banana. Their branding is fun and quirky with a distinctive shape and feel of the bottle, `as is their social media strategy <https://www.facebook.com/frijj>`_ - check out some of the photos.\r\n\r\nI started with the regular banana flavour. I was not overly impressed by just the smell - quite sharp and \"malty\", industrial in a negative way. However, tasting it was entirely different; fantastic with just the right texture. There's somehow an inherent \"stickiness\" in the drink too which is difficult to describe. Banana-wise, this is A+ work. The zenith of banana flavouring. Bravo.\r\n\r\nAnd in the red corner is... Banoffee Pie from the Supreme range. It's unclear exactly what is intended to be \"supreme\" about it. It was slightly more expensive than the regular whilst containing about 25% less. Deviously, the height is the same but the bottle itself is thinner...\r\n\r\nIn contrast with the banana flavour the smell here is extremely nice, particularly for a banoffee item. It turns out to be slightly thicker than the regular too and with a taste that's decidedly \"top shelf\". I'd probably still prefer the banana over this one, but it's absolutely nothing to be sneezed at.\r\n\r\nTwo fantastic drinks, both alike in dignity. Oh, I think they're now on offer at 65p.",

I took this bar along with me, assuming its banana nature would pep me up when I needed it most.

Projecting the annoyance at my clumsy concealmeant onto their well-intentioned industriousness, I opened my bar to find the worst-looking energy bar I've ever come across. Small, unappetising, dry and devoid of banana taste, I was tempted to not to even finish it.\r\n\r\nLooking at the silvery wrapper, I found myself noticing that whilst SiS stands for \"Science in Sport\" nobody seems to have made the obvious observation that if there's any sport that has had an `overdose of science <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRxs4AqsCI>`_, it's cycling.\r\n\r\nReaching into my back pocket I took out an actual banana, smiled, and continued into the sunrise.",

I've even spotted a `hole-in-the-wall banana bread outlet <http://www.broadgate.co.uk/BeanyGreenCoffee>`_ by Liverpool Street station which I have yet to make a withdrawal from.\r\n\r\nHowever, I picked up mine at \"As Nature Intended\", an even more upmarket version of Whole Foods. It's available in Tesco and Sainsbury's as well but these are vulgar stores to acquire organic produce from. The `Respect Organics <http://www.respectorganics.com/>`_ brand certainly has the right pedigree, airily throwing around \"sustainability\" and \"local\" just like the big boys. One thing though - \"Soil Association eggs\" doesn't make much sense to me, but then I didn't pay much attention in biology class...\r\n\r\nThe packaging is top notch, with a huge banana printed on the side and a transparent lid so you can get a real idea of what you've let yourself in for. There's also a practical internal corrugated cardboard \"cake tin\" which ensures the squashable contents are not easily damaged. `Soreen </day-2-soreen-banana-lunchbox-loaves>`_ could take notice.\r\n\r\nOpening it up, I was greeted by a lovely banana smell. The cake itself is just sweet enough and surprisingly moist given that it has a shelf life of about 2-3 weeks. After a few slices of my own\u2014ooh, that crust!\u2014I shared the rest with my colleagues over a morning status meeting - good reviews all round, or at least I haven't heard anything negative.\r\n\r\nEven with the \"organic tax\", it's extremely good value.

That was interesting.\r\n\r\nPowerBars have a long history in endurance sports and are actually one of the very first energy bars ever produced. A lot of the `old stories about them <http://forum.slowtwitch.com/forum/Slowtwitch_Forums_C1/Triathlon_Forum_F1/PowerBar_-_Some_History_P4925478-1>`_ still apply today. In particular, how bizarrely they behave in different temperatures: below 15\u00b0C they are hard as a rock requiring a careless attitude to dentistry to consume whilst above 20\u00b0C they are essentially a liquid and will fold over themselves in a despondent droop.\r\n\r\nFor a *sports* bar they are also extremely difficult to get out of packet one-handed and not at all straightforward for people still blessed with two; the bar sticks obstinately to the wrapper which never ever tears as intended. Has anyone from PowerBar actually used these things in anger?\r\n\r\nIndustrial in both taste and design, the rather curious flavours are recognised better by eye than by tongue, although this anonymity might paradoxically be an advantage after a sixth or seventh bar. It's quite intellectually stimulating to invent another foodstuff that PowerBars are a repurposed waste product from.\r\n\r\nI guess I would recognise the taste as banana, but only just - this is definitely \"work\" banana, not \"play\" banana, designed for efficient carbohydrate intake only.

Whey protein offers the *summa* of this, appearing to flog a bottle of perfume's worth of product in a cavenous vessel the size of an oil drum.\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar with whey protein powder, the idea is to add a scoop of powder into a \"shaker\", fill up with milk or water, shake for about 20 seconds and then casually drink it whilst out in public. Oh, this? Yeah, well, I guess I was just working out..\r\n\r\n(Anyone who has tried this exhibitionism knows the inevitable downside - you are nowhere near a water source to clean the container afterwards and opening even a day-old shaker results in a smell I would not wish on my worst enemy. At least two days for them.)\r\n\r\nIs it tasty? Yes. It's definitely nicer with milk, but the banana version of this product is almost as good with water, not the case with the other flavours I have tried. My pro tip is to use refrigerated water.\r\n\r\nThe powder also works surprisingly well as an ingredient - just stirring a teaspoon into some almost-ready porridge makes a fantastic replacement for cinnamon, but you can also bake it into cookies, cupcakes, make pancakes, stir it into yoghurt, make hash brownies... you get the idea.\r\n\r\nDo I recommend it? Well, I'm going to neatly sidestep all the broscience here; you already \"know\" if you want to buy whey protein\u2014probably entirely from a, err, lifestyle point of view\u2014but would definitely suggest trying this one first.

    "content": "How do you review the banana? Do notice the article there - it would be scientific to review a specific banana so that it can be compared with the other reviews, but wouldn't that be taking the easy way out? It is, after all, the star of the show, the man of the moment. The *ur*-fruit.\r\n\r\nLet's get a few things out of the way first. The `marshmellow eaters <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment>`_ amongst you will already been intrigued that I've awarded the banana 4/5 on the scale of \"banana-ness\". How is this possible?\r\n\r\nRecall what I're actually been scoring on - it's not always the most authentically banana-tasting products, rather ones that represent the idea or spirit of the banana. These \"hyper banana\" items, such as `Nesquik <http://31bananas.co.uk/day-30-nestle-nesquik-banana>`_ or `foamy bananas <http://31bananas.co.uk/day-11-the-co-operative-foamy-bananas>`_ simply have to score higher here, requiring a necessary adjustment in score here. Let me put it another way - is crack cocaine better than cocaine? Yes. Yes, it is.\r\n\r\nOf course, the banana will score 5/5 overall. Packaging and marketing? Well, it could be argued that it bruises easily but that's hardly fair - who, say, packs nectarines or plums carelessly into their hand luggage? Plus the lowly banana skin has been an unending font of slapstick humour as well as being fully biodegradable eons before the first Whole Foods. And the banana has no marketing either - you doesn't see adverts paid for by a \"banana board\" in an attempt to increase the nation's consumption - one just doesn't need encouragement to eat bananas. Hm, one doesn't see them for crack cocaine either. Let's move on.\r\n\r\nIf this was just another product I might reveal some interesting tidbit that you might find interesting, but what can I reveal that you don't already know?\r\n\r\nI suppose little is known of the bananas's versatility. Beyond the obvious banana sandwiches and toppings, our hero makes a very fine `single-ingredient ice cream <http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-creamy-ice-cream-with-just-one-ingredient-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-93414>`_, you can also mush one into porridge when it's about half done for a rather interesting texture, make `two-ingredient pancakes <http://www.ourbestbites.com/2014/02/2-ingredient-pancakes/>`_, is great late-night on the barbeque item wrapped in foil with chocolate, and rather good as `French Toast <http://www.tinnedtomatoes.com/2014/02/peanut-butter-nutella-and-banana-french.html>`_. This `Yummly search <http://www.yummly.co.uk/recipes?q=banana>`_ may give you some other ideas.\r\n\r\nWorth mentioning here would be the English tendency to prefer bananas when they are not really ripe, somehow misdiagnosing the smallest black speckle as the recurrence of some plague. Educating to the contrary is a sisyphean task not helped by this misunderstanding generating a lot of produce marked with those three beautiful words \"Reduced to Clear\".\r\n\r\nBut alas, it has come to draw this love letter to this charming fruit to a conclusion. We have come full circle together, or at least a kind of slightly curved crescent shape. Farewell, and see you all next month for 30 gooseberries.\r\n",

Catamite's Regret.\r\n\r\n And the pretend folksy names and fake artisanal packaging of these bottled beers conspires to give the functioning 45-year-old alcoholic the impression that he's not a functioning alcoholic but is instead some kind of connoisseur of beer, cutting a valuable exploratory swathe through an uncharted wilderness of 7.8% proof alcohol.\r\n\r\n But I've got news for you, Sainsbury's! I've seen through The Matrix, and an alcoholic is an alcoholic is an alcoholic, whether it's a tramp lying in the gutter drinking Buckfast or a 45-year-old father of two sitting at home alone in the middle of the night drinking Hadron's Collision.\r\n\r\nHe's certainly right about the `Googlewhack <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googlewhack>`_-esque labelling and constructed history. On the latter point, this beer is no exception: here's Karl Ottomar, Head Brewer at Wells & Young's, `writing in an interview <http://goodfoodgoodbeer.wordpress.com/2014/03/01/banana-bread-beer-charles-wells-enduring-oddity/>`_:\r\n\r\n  The idea of Banana Bread Beer initially came about as a suggestion from the wife of one of the Charles Wells team.\r\n\r\n... whilst the bottle has this far more, err, marketable narrative:\r\n\r\n   Long ago, ale was known as 'Liquid Bread'. We've used our long history of creating the finest malt blends & added fairtrade bananas to awaken the senses with a seriously fruity, rich, yet surprisingly versatile banana bread beer.\r\n\r\nBut enough of this sniping at such an easy target - is it actually any good?\r\n\r\nWell, falling flat right out of the starting gate I simply couldn't detect any hint of banana, either by smell or by an exploratory sip. Was my bottle a duff? Are my banana senses are dulled and muted? It just wasn't there. I like the *idea* of it being there and it could probably work quite well...? Not sure I can say much more.\r\n\r\nFailing that, is it a nice beer? I wouldn't be the person to ask. But if you like bananas *and* beer I'd buy some `lovely banana bread <http://31bananas.co.uk/day-19-respect-organics-banana-loaf-cake>`_ with your next bottle of Gandalf's Memory Stick instead.",
